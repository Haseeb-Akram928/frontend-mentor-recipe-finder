# 🍳 Recipe Finder Website (React)

This is my solution to the [Recipe Finder Website Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-finder-website--Ui-TZTPxN).  
It’s a **React-based recipe app** where users can search, filter, and explore recipes with a clean responsive design.  
The project helped me practice **state management**, **routing**, and **CSS reusability**.

## 📖 Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Navigate between **Home**, **About**, **Recipes Index**, and **Recipe Detail** pages
- **Search** for recipes by name or ingredient
- **Filter** recipes by maximum prep or cook time
- View an **optimal layout** on any device (mobile → desktop)
- See **hover and focus states** for all interactive elements

---

## 🛠 My Process

### Built With

- ⚛️ [React](https://reactjs.org/) – JS library for building UI
- 🔗 **React Router** – for page navigation
- 🎨 **CSS custom properties** – reusable styling
- 📐 **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** – layouts
- 📱 **Mobile-first workflow**

---

### 📚 What I Learned

- How to **manage global state** across multiple pages with **React Router**.
- The power of **CSS custom properties** for keeping styles clean and reusable.
- Structuring a React app for **scalability** when handling search, filters, and multiple views.

---

### 🚀 Continued Development

Future improvements I’d like to add:

- Implement **Context API** to remove prop drilling and simplify state management.
- Explore **Next.js** or SSR for performance gains.
- Improve **accessibility** (keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes).
